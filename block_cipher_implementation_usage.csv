AES,"128, 192, 256",128,High,Very High,Medium,Yes,Medium,Moderate,Yes,O(n),"AES is highly secure, fast, and widely supported in hardware and software."
DES,56,64,Low,Low,Low,No,Low,Simple,No,O(n),"DES is outdated and insecure, suitable only for legacy systems."
3DES,168,64,Low,Medium,High,No,Low,Moderate,No,O(3n),3DES provides moderate security but is slow and resource-intensive.
Blowfish,32-448,64,Medium,Medium,Low,No,Medium,Simple,Yes,O(n),Blowfish is fast and flexible but lacks hardware acceleration.
Twofish,"128, 192, 256",128,Medium,High,Medium,Yes,Medium,Moderate,Yes,O(n),Twofish offers strong security and balanced performance.
Serpent,"128, 192, 256",128,Low,Very High,High,No,Low,Complex,Yes,O(n),Serpent is very secure but slower than other modern ciphers.
